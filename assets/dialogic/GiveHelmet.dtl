ClickBug: What's up?

	set {Helmet} = true
	ClickBug: No way. You made this for me? \
I mean, of course you did, because I’m so awesome. The awesomest.
	ClickBug: Oh right, thanks. You prolly just saved my brain from any more damage.
	Player: You should thank Shyla as well. He’s the one who gave me the recipe, after all.
	ClickBug: ...It was Shyla’s recipe?
	ClickBug: Suppose I’ll have to thank him too.
- Nevermind
