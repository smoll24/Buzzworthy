Spider: What's up?
- Give Sword
	set {Sword} = true
	set {Helped} += 1
	Spider: What a wonder! This is... exquisite.\
For me, dear?
	Player: In return for your kind hospitality.
	Spider: Oh my silk! You shouldn’t have. \
But I’m so, so grateful that you did.
	Spider: You’ve got the kind of heart this forest needs more of. \
One that gives without waiting for a web to be spun in return.
	Spider: Thank you, my sweet little mothling.
- Nevermind
