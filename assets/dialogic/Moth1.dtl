Dub: Ah, you’re up. Took your time, didn’t you?
Dub: You heard the bells, same as the rest of us. Another meeting... same old promises, I’m sure.
Dub: We used to come together to plant, to sing, to celebrate the return of spring.
Dub: Now we meet to point fingers at shadows and argue over whose fault it is that the flowers won’t bloom.
Dub: Still, you best go. Maybe... maybe this time will be different. Maybe someone will actually do something.
